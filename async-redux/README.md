# Anime Info React-Redux Application

## About this App
My Web App uses React-Redux to handle the global state. As you can tell by the repo-name, this app was made to test my abilities of asynchronous-redux.

Honestly, I didn't think about it before I created this project, but the way I set up the app gets **EVERYTHING** anime related. Unfortunately that even means the NSFW.

Basically, this app isn't for the innocent of heart. Even if your heart isn't as innocent there is a chance you will fall deeper into the void.

### Tools used within this project

1. Third party MyAnimeList API created by [Jikan.moe](https://jikan.moe/)
2. React
3. Redux
